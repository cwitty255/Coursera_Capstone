I will need to process a list of Newcastle Upon Tyne areas which I have decided will be determined by UK Postcodes. I will be using a list of postcodes for the NE postcode area which I have sourced from Wikipedia.\n    - [List of NE Postcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NE_postcode_area)\n\n#### 2. I will also need a list of the populations of each postcode area:\n    -[Population by Postcode](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/ks101ew)\n    - Note this data has been sanitised and uploaded as [censuspop.csv](https://github.com/cwitty255/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/censuspop.csv)\n\n#### 3. I will need a list of Newcastle Upon Tyne area average after tax income broken down by postal code. **Note:** These statistics have been downloaded manually and can be found here in my git repo.\n    -[NE Income Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/smallareaincomeestimatesformiddlelayersuperoutputareasenglandandwales)\n    - The data has been sanitised and can be found [here](https://github.com/cwitty255/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/income_by_postcode.csv)\n\n#### 4. I then need the same median but for all of the United Kingdom by Postcode.\nHere we must also manually download this from Stats Canada and load them.\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/1002964/average-full-time-annual-earnings-in-the-uk/\nBritish families and individuals had a median after-tax income of \u00a331,461 in 2020\n\n#### 5. We are going to need a list of all Restaurant Venues from all neighborhoods in Newcastle Upon Tyne by Postal code\nFor this I will use FourSquare API to download all venues from all neighborhoods in Newcastle Upon Tyne.\nhttps://api.foursquare.com\nExtract Restaurants and only include Restaurants in our Data Set.\n\n#### 6. I will combine all of this information into a suitable working Data Set which will be used for clustering and Geo-Spatial mapping of the results which will show the best area to a open a delivery service.\n\nThe compiled data set will clearly demonstrate:\n\n- Which neighborhoods in Newcastle Upon Tyne have clusters of like Restaurants\n- The average net income of all areas\n- The population of each area\n- Which are we should target to setup our restaurant delivery service\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
