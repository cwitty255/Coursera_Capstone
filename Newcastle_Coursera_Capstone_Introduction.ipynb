We decided that we need to figure out which area in the city has the highest concentration of restaurants in the city, so we can set up a successful business.\n\nThe type of business we are intending to creae is similar to the following:\n- https://www.just-eat.co.uk/\n- https://deliveroo.co.uk/\n- https://www.ubereats.com/gb\n\nMe and my colleague sat down and determined the following requirements after conducting some market research:\n\n#### Prediciment:\n1. Which area should we open up our new delivery service in Newcastle Upon Tyne to ensure frequent, sustainable and lucrative business?\n\n#### Initial Assumptions:\n1. Potential customers of the service will be aware of it's existance and we are assuming that this will not impact our data regarding population statistics.\n2. If all requirements are met then the following can be assumed to be true:\n- Minimal average cost for delivery will be met.\n- Overall travelling time is reduced for all delivery drivers \n- Lower organisational cost for me and my colleague.\n\n#### Business Requirements:\n\n1. Delivery service base must be located within the largest conentration of restaurents within Newcastle Upon Tyne\n2. Ensure that a suitable number of potential customers can utilise our service with sustained frequency.\n    -Does this area have an average income which is close to the UK national average?\n    -Does the area have a suitably sized population?\n3. Validate and verify assumptions about the scenario by modelling and testing the data using visualised clusters of restaurants in the Newcastle Upon Tyne\n\n#### Optional Requirements:\n1. Identify which areas surrounding Newcastle Upon Tyne may have an increased number of restaurants in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
